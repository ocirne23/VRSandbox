// The engine-exposure registry for the DSL: the ONE table describing what scripts can touch. Exposing an
// engine function that already exists on the ScriptContext ABI (Code/Script/Public/ScriptAPI.h) costs exactly
// one BindingFunc row here; exposing brand-new C++ additionally costs the ABI's own minimal trio (X-macro row +
// thunk + ctor init line in Code/Entity/Private/ScriptContext.cpp).
//
// The transpilation model (Transpiler.cpp): each DSL function becomes its own free `SCRIPT_EXPORT` function,
// like the node system's generated .scr code -- no wrapper class, no per-component member. `ctx`/`self` are
// auto-injected as every generated function's first two parameters (invisible to the DSL author), so a
// binding's `emit` template can reference them directly ("$r" = the receiver's own emitted expression, "$1..$n"
// = arguments): self's own functions/members call straight through the real ctx-> thunks (e.g.
// "ctx->entitySetEnabled($r, $1)"), while a component member (self.physics) resolves to "scriptData-><name>" --
// a pointer the HOST caches once, engine-side, right after allocating ScriptData (see ScriptRequiredComponentsFn
// in ScriptAPI.h and ScriptComponent::spawn), not a per-access ctx-> fetch. A script declares which components
// it requires (DSL::requiredComponents); assignment-time validation (future work) guarantees required members
// are never null.
//
// EXTENSIBLE: registerStruct/registerObject/registerEntryPoint are public, so any library can expose its own
// script bindings -- this registry has NO built-in content of its own (not even vec2/3/4 or self): every DSLType
// it knows about, structs and components alike, was registered by SOME caller through this exact same path.
// registerStruct returns the DSLType it just assigned immediately, usable right away in a LATER registration
// call's own parameter/return types; typeByName is the same lookup for an EXISTING struct (e.g. vec3) a new
// registration wants to reference without needing that earlier call's return value handed to it directly.
// Registration order matters: nothing here happens automatically or lazily, so the ENGINE (Entity's
// registerScriptDslBindings, called once from main before anything touches this registry -- see its own
// comment) is what guarantees the base vocabulary (vec2/3/4, self, ...) exists before either the DSL editor or
// any OTHER library's own registration call runs, same as any other cross-library Globals dependency in this
// codebase (see ScriptEventManager::initialize's comment).
//
// Editor-side, the registry replaces the hardcoded builtins: build() constructs the SAME two DSLSymbol vectors
// every consumer (AutoCompleteRules/ScriptLoader/editor) already reads -- sidebar VariableDeclarations for the
// binding objects, builtin FunctionDeclarations for every function (engine free functions plus
// requiresReceiver=true entries for object functions) -- from every struct/object registered SO FAR; a
// registration made AFTER build() runs exists in the registry (queryable via typeByName/structs/objects) but
// never gets symbols built for it, so every registration -- built-in or external -- needs to happen before the
// one build() call (ScriptEditor's, currently). ALL bindings are built regardless of the require set -- stable
// symbol identity forever; DSL::requiredComponents only gates what autocomplete OFFERS and what the loader/
// panel accept.
