	//            density. A generator whose field is built hierarchically may answer these from a much
	//            cheaper level; one that is a plain function of (x, z) just ignores the hint.
	// This exists because V3 (diffusion) generates 7.68 km TILES at real cost: a far cascade covering the
	// whole view distance would otherwise force thousands of full-detail tiles — for terrain largely beyond
	// the mesh ring — and evict the ones the geometry needs. V3 answers Coarse from its coarse stage alone,
	// where one tile covers several hundred km. The shader crossfades near->far, so the drop in fidelity
