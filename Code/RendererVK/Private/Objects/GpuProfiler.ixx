// shows them on the same timeline as the CPU threads. One query pool per frame-in-flight; scopes are
// recorded into the PRIMARY command buffer (re-recorded every frame) OUTSIDE render passes only
// (multiview render passes replicate timestamp writes per view). Results are read back in
// Renderer::beginFrame after the slot's fence wait (~NUM_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT frames latent) and mapped
// onto the CPU tick timeline via VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps (QPC domain) when available, else
// anchored to the CPU submit time.
